# Comparison between four waves of SARS-CoV-2 in Bogot치: a retrospective analysis over two years

In this repository we characterized and compared, using statistical tools, the first four consecutive epidemiological waves in the Bogot치, Colombia, that occurred between March 2020 and April 2022. We used the report of confirmed cases from the [District Health Secretary of Bogot치](https://datosabiertos.bogota.gov.co/dataset/numero-de-casos-confirmados-por-el-laboratorio-de-covid-19-bogota-d-c) , and the genomic surveillance data published by the [Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)](https://gisaid.org/). We focused mainly on the estimation of:

1. The instantaneous reproduction number R(t).
2. The transmissibility advantage between variants.
3. The delay times for onset-to-hospitalization, onset-to-ICU, onset-to-death, hospital stay, and ICU stay., 
4. The characterization of severe outcomes using the proportion of cases using the general hospital and ICU services, as well, as deaths, and the severe ratios: Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Hospitalization Case Rate (HCR), and Hospitalization Fatality Rate (HFR) for each wave. 

## Data sources

1. Report of confirmed cases from the [District Health Secretary of Bogot치](https://datosabiertos.bogota.gov.co/dataset/numero-de-casos-confirmados-por-el-laboratorio-de-covid-19-bogota-d-c) (Private database - last update: )

2. Genomic surveillance data published by the [Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID)](https://gisaid.org/) (Public database - last update: 2022-08-02)

## Methods

1. Reproduction number R(t): we estimated the time-varying instantaneous reproduction number R(t) using the epidemiological package for R: [EpiEstim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html)

2. Transmissibility advantage: we evaluated the transmissibility advantage using a multinomial logistic regression with a single explanatory variable $t$ given by:

$$f(v,t)=\alpha + \beta_{0,v}t$$

In the previous expression $\alpha$ is the intercept of the model and $\beta_{0,v}$ is the variant-specific parameter for the time covariate, which was computed with respect to a reference (or pivot) variant. Notice that $\beta_{0,v}$ represents the transmissibility advantage with respect to the pivot variant. The relative transmissibility advantages between other variants were computed as:

$$\beta_{w,v} = \beta_{0,w} - \beta_{0,v}$$

The multinomial regressions were run in stan through the library [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for python.

3. Probability distributions of delay times: we used a bayesian hierarchical model based on [this repository](https://github.com/mrc-ide/Brazil_COVID19_distributions). We fitted initial parameters for the district level and the sample the parameters for each wave. For that purpose we used a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm implemented in Stan, setting four chains of 2000 iterations (1000 for warming up and 1000 for sampling). These models were also run using [PyStan](https://pystan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

4. Severe outcomes: we computed the proportion of severe outcomes (general hospitalization, ICU, and death) between the Covid-19 cases, with a confidence interval of 95% for binomial proportions; and the Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Hospitalization Case Rate (HCR), and Hospitalization Fatality Rate (HFR) for each wave, disaggregated by 10 years age-groups. Additionally, we calculated the contribution of waves to severe outcomes by age-groups.
